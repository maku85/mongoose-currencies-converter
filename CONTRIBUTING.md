# Contributing

If you wish to contribute, the only requirement is to:

1. create your feature/fix branch from master (`git checkout -b my-new-branch`) - if you're working on an
  issue, prefix it with the issue number
2. make the changes, with accompanying test cases
3. commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added my changes'`)
4. push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-branch`)
5. create new Pull Request

Feel free to ping me if you need help! :)
